    </div>

            <li>**Increased Productivity**: Keeps your IT environment running smoothly, so your team can focus on core tasks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How secure is remote monitoring?</h4>
        <p>Our RMM platform uses encrypted connections, multi-factor authentication, and access controls to keep your data and systems secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What happens if an issue cannot be fixed remotely?</h4>
        <p>If an issue requires on-site support, we work with your team to coordinate prompt, professional assistance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
    <h4>What are the cost benefits of RMM over standard remote support?</h4>
    <p>
        **Lower Operational Costs**: RMM’s proactive approach can reduce downtime by up to 50%, saving an estimated $5,000–$10,000 annually in productivity and emergency repair costs for a small to medium business.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Fixed Monthly Cost**: RMM typically costs between $50–$150 per device per month, offering predictable expenses. Standard remote support, however, can charge $100–$300 per incident, meaning businesses may face unexpected bills, especially during high-demand periods.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Efficiency Gains**: Automated patching and updates with RMM save approximately 10–15 hours per month in IT labor, worth around $1,000–$1,500 monthly based on industry averages. Additionally, avoiding unpatched vulnerabilities can save businesses from potential breaches, which cost small businesses an average of $50,000 per incident.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Scalability**: As your business grows, RMM can scale efficiently with minimal extra costs. By contrast, standard support often charges $100–$150 for each additional device. Over a year, RMM's scalability could save $3,000–$5,000 compared to traditional support models as your device count increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Improved Productivity**: Minimizing disruptions through proactive monitoring and rapid responses to potential issues helps reduce downtime by up to 60%. This can save $8,000–$15,000 in lost productivity annually for a typical 25-employee business.
